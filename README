This meta-layer collects the patches necessary to make the overlays work with
the i.MX6 family of chips.
The version of the Linux Kernel targetted by these patches is 4.1.15, but the
same patches may apply on top of other versions.

To add support to overlays on your design, just include file:
recipes-kernel/linux/overlays.inc
from your kernel recipe.

If you also want to add the expansion manager to your system, make sure you
add "expansion-manager" to the list of packages to install in the final image
